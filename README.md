The memory matching game is designed to challenge players' ability to recall and match pairs of emoji cards. The game consists of a set of cards that start face down, and players must flip them over to find matching pairs. Throughout the game, the player's score and the number of moves they make are recorded. Players also have the option to restart the game or shuffle the cards at any time for a fresh start.

Interacting with the cards is intuitive and engaging. A double tap flips a card face up, revealing its emoji. Players can also drag the cards around the screen, although they will return to their original position. Additionally, rotation gestures allow for card rotation, adding an extra layer of interactivity. Once a pair is matched, the cards become semi-transparent, signifying a successful match. To enhance the visual experience, flipping a card triggers a 3D flip animation.
